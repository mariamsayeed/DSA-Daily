*Steps to apply Bubble Sort:*
1. push the maximum to the last by adjacent swapping
2. compare adjacent element and if the next element is greater than the previous element than swap the elements
3. at every iteration the max element is push at the last of array
4. after n-1 iterations the array is sorted

## TIME COMPLEXITY
    TC -> O(n^2) {worst case and average case}
    TC -> O(n) {best case}
    SC -> O(1)
